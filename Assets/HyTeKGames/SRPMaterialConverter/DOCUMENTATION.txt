SRP Material Converter Documentation

1) Import the SRP Material Converter in your Unity project.
2) Navigate to Tools > HyTeKGames > SRP Material Converter.
3) Select materials by dragging them into "Materials" or use "Find broken materials."
   - Verify detection, as some materials may compile and not be detected despite being broken.
4) Set the "Original Pipeline" for selected materials.
   - The target pipeline is usually pre-set.
5) To preview without overriding, click "Convert", To override, check "Override original materials." and click "Convert".

Important:
- Code is not meant for modification but is not obfuscated; it uses a custom reader for broken materials.
- If modification is needed, explore scripts in Assets/HyTeKGames/SRPMaterialConverter (prefixed with SRPMC for SRPMaterialConverter).
- The code has comments to guide you through any potential modifications.
- Editor UI is built with Unity UI Toolkit.
- All our code is under the "HyTeKGames.SRPMaterialConverter" namespace for ease of use.

Happy converting!
